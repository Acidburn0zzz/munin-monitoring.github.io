				<h2>What is Munin?</h2>
				<p>Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool that can help analyze resource trends and "what just happened
					to kill our performance?" problems. It is designed to be very plug and play. A default installation provides
					a lot of graphs with almost no work.</p>
				<p>In Norse mythology Hugin and Munin are the ravens of the god king Odin. They flew all over Midgard for him,
					seeing and remembering, and later telling him. "Munin" means "memory".</p>
